When you see people smiling, you know they’re happy. When they’re crying, you know they’re sad. Across cultures, recognizable facial expressions and certain reactions have become associated with the basic emotions. You pick up on these visual cues from person to person, but do you know what goes into them? Below, we explore the theories of basic emotions.

## 1. The Six Basic Emotions
A widely accepted theory of basic emotions and their expressions, developed **Paul Ekman**, suggests we have six basic emotions. They include happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust.
### 1.1 Happiness
A pleasant emotional state that elicits feelings of joy, contentment and satisfaction

*Expression: Smile, laughter*

### 1.2 Sadness
An emotional state characterized by feelings of disappointment, grief or hopelessness

*Expression: Frown, loss of focus in eyes, tears*

### 1.3 Fear
A primal emotion that is important to survival and triggers a fight or flight response

*Expression: Wide eyes, tense stretched lips*

### 1.4 Anger
An emotional state leading to feelings of hostility and frustration

*Expression: Glare, eyebrows drawn together, tight lips*

### 1.5 Surprise
A brief emotional state, either positive or negative, following something unexpected

*Expression: Raised brows, open mouth, gasp*

### 1.6 Disgust
A strong emotion that results in feeling repulsed
